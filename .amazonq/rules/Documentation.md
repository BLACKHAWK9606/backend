for this development, I will need u to be delivering and updating a .md file in the root of the project. In this .md, think of it as a documenting file where we clearly describe the what, the how, the where and the how of everything we d, such that we create an interactive .md document that we will be updating as we go such that we do not lose track of what we are doing, and we can always come back to the documentation in future if need be.


Make the .md.

Note, it's not supposed to be that much of a technical document, but rather as a bridge that looks to act as the explainer of what we did, why we did it, where we did it, and how we did it, for me as a developer, for my seniors who will want explanations on what I did, and for other developers who may want to follow what I did, so be keen on this,

This file will be updated every once in a while when we reach a major checkpoint in development, when we confirm everything we worked on for that milestone is accomplished and works wel
